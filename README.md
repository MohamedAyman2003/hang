# Hangman Game

This is a simple Hangman game built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The game allows players to guess letters to uncover a hidden word within a limited number of attempts.



## Usage

1. Upon opening the game, you will be presented with an empty word to guess and a set of buttons representing each letter of the alphabet.
2. Click on a letter button to make a guess.
3. If the guessed letter is present in the hidden word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s).
4. If the guessed letter is not present in the hidden word, one part of the hangman figure will be drawn.
5. Keep guessing letters until you either uncover the entire word or run out of attempts (hangman figure is completely drawn).
6. You win if you correctly guess all letters before running out of attempts; otherwise, you lose.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the game by modifying the CSS styles and JavaScript code:

- To change the appearance of elements such as buttons or text, modify the styles defined in `styles.css`.
- To add or modify words that can be used for guessing, update the array `words` defined in `script.js`.
